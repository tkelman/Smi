Prerequisites for installation:
- at the moment on (*)nix platforms you must use g++ 2.95.2 or higher.
- must use gnu make
- to make the documentation doxygen must be installed
- you must install OSL Stochastic Extensions for your platform 
  from http://www-3.ibm.com/software/data/bi/osl/
  and edit Makefile.locations to identify where these are to be found.

Targets are put in subdirectories, whose name is derived from the
platform name (as returned by `uname`) and the optimization level
(e.g., Linux-g).

To build Smi library and unitTest
  - First build Osi library. See Osi/INSTALL below the COIN root
    directory.
  - Read and edit the top of Makefile to select
      - whether shared or static library should be built
      - optimization level
      - where the compiled library should be installed
      - which solvers you want to compile in.
  - 'make' to build and install the library.
  - 'make unitTest' to create the unitTest program. It will be placed
    in the target subdirectory.

  - 'make doc' to create the html documentation of the classes in the
    library and place them in doc/html.

To run Cmi unitTest
  - ./TARGET_SUBDIRECTORY/unitTest
    where TARGET_SUBDIRECTORY is the name of the subdirectory
    containing the unitTest executable.
